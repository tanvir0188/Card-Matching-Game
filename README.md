5 different items appear twice in these cards.

## How to Play:
### Flip a Card:
The player starts by flipping over one card to reveal the item underneath.

### Find a Match:
The player then flips another card to try to find the same item.
If the second card matches the first card (i.e., both cards reveal the same item), the pair is detected, and the player continues the game.

If the second card does not match the first, the player loses immediately.

Objective: The player must correctly match all identical pairs without making any mistakes.
## Key Rule:
The player cannot flip a third card or "reset" mismatched cards. If two cards flipped consecutively do not match, the game is lost. But it still allows the player to continue to get some scores.

This makes the game more challenging because it requires the player to rely on memory to find and match all pairs perfectly without any errors.

## Winning Condition:
To win, the player must successfully match all identical pairs without ever flipping two different items consecutively.
